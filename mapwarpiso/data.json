The Post-Collection Separation Facility would accept 950 tons of municipal solid waste (MSW), construction and demolition debris, and 100 tons of wood waste per day for gasification to biomass fuel and recover other recyclable products. The Gasification System would produce a clean, medium calorific value syngas that would be consumed in the Combined Cycle Power Island to generate 24 megawatts (20 megawatts net) of renewable energy electric power. The Project is projected to reduce air pollutant emissions by about half that of MSW disposed in a landfill or by about one third if disposed in an incinerator.
